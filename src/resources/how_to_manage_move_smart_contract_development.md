# How to Manage a Move Smart Contract Development

The following doc outlines the guidelines on how to set up and manage a smart contract development on Aptos.

### Create Package

1. Initialize a Move package by running:

```bash
aptos move init --name <PROJECT_NAME>
```

project-folder/
├── contract/
│ ├── sources
│ ├── scripts
│ ├── tests
│ ├── Move.toml

2. Update Move.toml

```rust
[package]
name = "<name-of-your-package>"
version = "<version-of-your-package>"

[addresses]
<names-address> = "_"

[dev-addresses]
<names-address> = "0x123"

[dependencies.AptosFramework]
git = "https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-framework.git"
rev = "mainnet"
subdir = "aptos-framework"
```

### Compiling

Once you have a package set up, you can compile your Move code by doing:

```bash
aptos move compile --dev
```

### Testing

Unit testing for Move adds three new annotations to the Move source language:

#[test] #[test_only], and #[expected_failure]

Run Unit Tests:

```bash
aptos move test --dev
```
