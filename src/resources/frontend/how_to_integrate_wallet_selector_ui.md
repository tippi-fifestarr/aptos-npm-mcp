# How to Integrate a Wallet Selector UI

The Wallet Adapter repository provides several UI packages to simplify allowing users to connect and select a wallet.

For UI components that work out of the box, but are less customizable, choose one of the optiona below.

## Ant Design

Package for wallet selector modal using Ant Design. Includes a wallet connect button when clicked, opens up a wallet select modal.

If wallet is already connected, the button would display the connected account address truncated (i.e 0x123...abc), in that case, clicking the button would disconnect the wallet.

### Usage

Make sure you have `@aptos-labs/wallet-adapter-react` installed

```bash
npm install @aptos-labs/wallet-adapter-ant-design@latest
```

on `index.tsx / _app.tsx` import the ant-design package `.css` file as

```bash
// If you use a local css file in your app, import it before the package's file as order matters
import "./my-style-file.css";

import "@aptos-labs/wallet-adapter-ant-design/dist/index.css";
```

On the page you want to include the wallet connect button, import the `WalletSelector` module.

```jsx
import { WalletSelector } from "@aptos-labs/wallet-adapter-ant-design";
...
return (
  <WalletSelector />
)
```

That would add a Connect Wallet button when clicked opens up a wallet selector modal.

### (Optional) Override styles

You can override these classes

```bash
.wallet-selector-modal
.wallet-selector-icon
.wallet-selector-text
.wallet-menu-wrapper
.wallet-name-wrapper
.wallet-connect-button
.wallet-connect-install
.wallet-button
.wallet-modal-title
.aptos-connect-button
.aptos-connect-privacy-policy-wrapper
.aptos-connect-privacy-policy-text
.aptos-connect-privacy-policy-link
.aptos-connect-powered-by
.about-aptos-connect-trigger-wrapper
.about-aptos-connect-trigger
.about-aptos-connect-header
.about-aptos-connect-graphic-wrapper
.about-aptos-connect-text-wrapper

.about-aptos-connect-description
.about-aptos-connect-footer-wrapper
.about-aptos-connect-screen-indicators-wrapper
.about-aptos-connect-screen-indicator
```

For example, to override the connect wallet button background color, you can use the .wallet-button class in your local .css file

```jsx
.wallet-button{
  background-color: red;
}
```
